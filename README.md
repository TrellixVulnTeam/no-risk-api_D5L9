# no-risk-api
NO RISK is a class project for the subject "Software Engineering Processes" at University of Almer√≠a. This is a simple webapp that allow you to manage users, projects and risks.

This is the "back-end" part where we are using Pythong with Django and Django Rest Framework. This is my first contact with Django Rest framework, which means the code is very basic and with lots of room for improvement.

I'm not thinking about improving it at any time soon, but it has been a great first contact with the library and I am willing to start new projects and learn it in depth.
